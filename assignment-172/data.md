background va background-color property in CSS
==============================================
The major difference between CSS background vs background-color property is that the background property is shorthand of all background properties. On the other hand, the background-color property is the subset of the background property used to set the background color. Moreover, our expert developers compare and describe the differences between these two properties in this article.

margin:auto
===========
You can set the margin property to auto to horizontally center the element within its container.

To keep the width at 300px, no matter the amount of padding, you can use the box-sizing property. This causes the element to maintain its actual width; if you increase the padding, the available content space will decrease.
